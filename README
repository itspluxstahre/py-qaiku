A python interface against qaiku.com (via JSON)

Requires:
    * Python 2.6 or later
    * HTTPLib2 
    * Json
    * Markdown
    * urllib

This is a library to work with the Qaiku API,
it will map everything to python objects to make
things easier when embedding this into other applications.

Basic Usage:
    from qaiku import Qaiku

    qc = Qaiku(api_key="your_uniqe_api_key", source="Your Application Name")
    message = qc.PostUpdate("Posting messages to qaiku with python is cool!")
    print message.id

Object Comparison:
    All objects have function like __eq__() and __ne__() to allow easy compares 
    between two objects.

    Ex: print User1 == User2

Object __init__:
    All objects except the main Qaiku object can be called in three diffrent
    ways to init them.

    1. As any other object:
        * MyMessage = QaikuMessage(id="312312asfa2" ... )
    
    2. With a valid json string:
        * MyMessage = QaikuMessage.fromJson("{id: "231231232" ... ")
        
    3. With a valid python dict()
        * MyMessage = QaikuMessage.fromDict(" ... )

Todo:
    * Fix a small "bug" with QaikuGeo (Floating points...)
    * Add markdown support.
